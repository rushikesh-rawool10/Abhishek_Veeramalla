1. Image pull back of

Due to wrong image name or image doesn't exist
Due to private image repository

To solve private image repository issue
Use image PullSecret inside spec: in deployment.yml

First it will throw error image pull
Then it will wait for sometime, this issue can be because of network issue.
It will try to pull one more time again wait for sometime.
Incrementally it will increase wait time. This is called back off delay. That's why this error is called image pull back off.

Kubectl create secret docker-registry (secret name) --docker -server=(your-registry-server) --docker-username=(your-name) --docker-password=(your-password) --docker-email(your-mail)


----
Crash loop back off
Due to multiple reasons

Misconfigurations- wrong environmental variables
Persistence volume that doesn't exist

Errors in liveness probe- misconfigurations in liveness probe

The memory limits are too low

Wrong command line arguments

Bugs and exceptions

Example- wrong CMD command in docker file


Liveness probe
The process of kublet identifes pod is healthy or not

Readyness probe
Is used to check whether your pod is ready to accept traffic or not

To avoid out of memory issues-

At namespace level use resource quota- mad resources that a namespace can consume

At pod level, Resource limits are use- max resources that a pod can consume
. don't increase CPU or MEMORY directly, it is not the solution and a very bad practice.
Devloper should identify the root cause on why the pod is taking more resources than expected
