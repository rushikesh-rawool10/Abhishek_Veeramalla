argo image updater--> 1. monitoring the container registry(dockerhub)
                      2. updating the github repo

How CD works?
as soon as CI process is completed, a new image version is updated in your container registry.
Argo image updater continuously monitors the container registry, it will go to the application's manifest git repo( having pod.yml, deployment.yml, helm charts).
Argo image updater updates the application's manifest repo with new container image(new tag)
Argo CD which is kubernetes controller, always make a sync between application's manifest git repo and k8's cluster
