Branches-- 

Master / main branch by default

Feature branch

Release branch

Hotfix branch


Master branch need to be be updated every time

Later Feature and hotfix branches should be merged with master branch


Hotfix branch means emergency changes need to fix on the production. It stay there for 2/3 days

After need to merge with master and release branches and end of the day  release branch need to deliver to customer

=====================================
If want go with previous version 1
first git log
check for commit id that you want go with, copy it
git reset --hard commit id

=======================================
Master/main branch
feature branch--different feature branch for different features and will merge to master branch
release branch--all features are tested and working properly and need to deliver to customer and want to test the working.

for deleivery to customer instead of using master, use release because on master branch developers actively working and not for all the time new features need to deliver to customer
so create separate/tested branch for release i.e release branch

hotfix branches--if customer facing some major issue in app and need to fix/release that immedaitly
then use hotfix
