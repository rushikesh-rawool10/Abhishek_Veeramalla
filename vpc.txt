VPC

Region (land)
VPC (secured area)
how much secured area?---> ip-address range  192.178.0.0/16--65536

192.178.0.0/16--65536-->Subnets 192.178.1.0/24
						        192.178.2.0/24
						        192.178.3.0/24
						
Internet request--->Internet gateway-->Public subnet--->load balancer--target group-->private subnet/appliacation-->route table-->security group

The website you are accessing should not not know the ip address of your private subnet/application
need masking of ip address
maskingof ip address--NAT

security is shared resposibility

security group-->inbound + outbound rules

inbound --by default --none--no one is allowed--to access define ip adress in inbound rules

outbound--ec2 to outside--by default all open except port 25--mail service

security group at ec2 level
NACL at subnet level
NACl additional layer of security

security group has only allow rules
in NACL has both allow and Deny

as secuity group at instace level, every time we need to configure for each instace
in NACL we can directly apply to 10k instaces


NACL is first level of defence, as SG at ec2 level we do not have control on each ec2 instance,
we can set rules allow/deny in NACL and attach to vpc, so it apply to ec2 instaces created inside vpc's

NACL follows ascending order
if it allows all traffic at no.1 & deny 8000 at no.2, it will pass through NACL
