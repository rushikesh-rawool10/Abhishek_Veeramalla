Copy command copy the files from host system into the container

Multistage docker build

They are very small and light weight images

Challenges with Docker

Docker daemon is a single point of failure
Docker daemon uses root user which is security threat
Resource constraints-  if you run too many containers on single machine you may face slow performance or crash

How to secure docker container

Use of distroless Images
Use multistage docker build
Use custom bridge network for isolation
