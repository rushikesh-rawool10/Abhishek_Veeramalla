Hypervisor uses the concept of virtualization
  virtualization--> creating virtual servers on top of physical servers.
  virtual machine is a logical isolation
each app has its own operating system

Docker containers are lightweight in nature, because they do not have a complete operating system.
they use resources from the base operating system.
containers have a minimal operating system--> base image.

A container is a package that is a combination of application, required libraries/dependencies plus system dependencies
