==================================================================

Step 1
The client accesses a website and requests to download a file (like image file).

Step 2
Now, the DNS routes the client request to the nearest edge location through CloudFront to serve the user request.

Step 3
At edge location, CloudFront looks for its requested cache file. Once the file is found, CloudFront sends the file to the user.

Step 4
But, if the file is not found then CloudFront compares the requirements with the specifications and shares it with the respective server. 

Step 5
The web server responds to the request by sending the files back to the CloudFront edge location

Step 6:
As soon CloudFront receives the file, it shares it with the client and adds the file to the edge location
